"""
A Flask web application to compare the content of two files or text inputs. This module utilizes 
the Flask framework to create a simple web interface where users can upload two files or input text
into two separate forms. The application then compares the contents of these two inputs, using the 
`difflib` module, to generate a detailed, side-by-side comparison of the differences. The 
comparison highlights additions, deletions, and unchanged lines between the two inputs. The results
are displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing for easy visualization of differences.
The application supports both GET and POST requests, rendering an initial form for input on a GET
request, and processing the submitted content on a POST request to display the comparison results.
Dependencies:
    - Flask: A micro web framework for Python, used for handling web requests 
    and rendering templates.
    - difflib: A module in the Python standard library, used to compare sequences,
    in this case, lines of text from the input files or texts.

    """
    The main view function that handles requests to the root URL ('/').
    On a GET request, this function renders an initial HTML form allowing the user to either upload
    two files or enter text into two separate input fields for comparison.
    On a POST request, the function processes the uploaded files or entered text, compares the 
    content using the `difflib.ndiff` method, and generates a list of differences. These 
    differences are processed to support side-by-side comparison, distinguishing between added 
    lines, deleted lines, and unchanged lines.
    The comparison results are then rendered and displayed to the user in a 'results.html' 
    template, providing a visual representation of differences between the two inputs.
    Parameters:
    - None explicitly; uses `request` context from Flask to access submitted data.
    Returns:
    - A rendered template: 'index.html' for a GET request, or 'results.html' with comparison 
    results for a POST request.
